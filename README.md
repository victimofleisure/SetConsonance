# SetConsonance

This Windows console app performs various functions related to composing atonal chord progressions with balanced Gray interval sets. It's related to the [BalaGrayIter](https://github.com/victimofleisure/BalaGrayIter) project and my paper [Granular 12-Tone Harmony via Mixed-Radix Balanced Gray Codes: Interval Sets and the BalaGray Solver](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16041343).
